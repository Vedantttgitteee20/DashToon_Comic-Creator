## Feature

* Generate images based on text given
* Generate any number of comic strips you need
* Remove any strip any time
* A Comic Panel to compile all generated images
* Increased flexiblity in generation of comic so that user can focus more on content and story than on making illustrations

## Scope of improvement
* UI can be improved further to attract users
* API to generate image can be improved by researching platforms for hosting
* Use of context in website so that the images that are generated in sequence to the images before have some relevant link between them
* Add facility to user to change panel size of each comic strip as per his/her creativity
* Add option to add dailogues, better if all dailogue boxes can diverge from face of character
* Feedback mechanism to feed what went wrong in generating images so that api can provide better images next time
